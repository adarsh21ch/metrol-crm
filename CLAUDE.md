# Metrol Media CRM — project context

**Read this file first.** It carries everything from the previous session so you can continue without that chat history.

## What this is

An in-house CRM for **Metrol Media** (metrol.in) — the company Adarsh works at. Not a SaaS product, not part of the Nevorai family. One company, one team, internal use only.

Adarsh is the developer/owner of this build. He is **non-technical-leaning** — always end replies with a plain-language numbered **"WHAT YOU DO NEXT"** section. He is also **cost-conscious about Claude usage**: batch your checks, don't iterate one query at a time, don't re-derive things this file already answers.

## The quality bar (stated by the client-facing side)

> "It should not look childish, incomplete, or have bad UI/UX. Give them more than they expect. But maintain a minimalistic approach — do not include unnecessary features which they did not ask for. If they later ask, we can build that."

So: **spend effort on polish and smoothness, not on extra modules.** No feature creep. When tempted to add something, don't — note it instead.

## Current state

- **`design/metrol-crm-prototype.html`** — a single-file clickable prototype covering all 5 screens. This is the design source of truth. It is **not** the app; no real code is scaffolded yet.
- Published as an Artifact: https://claude.ai/code/artifact/6cf4afe7-4d07-4b9e-8619-175b16c13949
  To update that same link, publish with `url` set to it. Publishing without `url` from a new conversation creates a *separate* artifact.
- Verified working: column resize (drag/dbl-click reset/min clamp), live KPI recalculation, assign modal, status+quality dropdowns, convert→record-sale→owner-sees-it flow, light/dark, mobile.

### How to preview it locally

The file has no `<!doctype>/<html>/<body>` wrapper (the Artifact host adds those). To test in a browser, wrap a copy **inside the current project folder** or the preview pane renders it as a dead static snapshot:

```bash
{ printf '<!doctype html><html><head><meta charset="utf-8"><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1"></head><body>\n'; cat design/metrol-crm-prototype.html; printf '\n</body></html>\n'; } > .preview.html
```

Then open `file:///Users/apple/metrol-crm/.preview.html` in the Browser pane. Delete `.preview.html` when done. Note: `.workspace` has `scroll-behavior:smooth` — set it to `auto` before measuring element positions in tests, or you'll measure mid-animation.

## Stack decisions (settled — don't relitigate)

- **Not Lovable.** Hand-coded here.
- **Supabase** — Postgres + Auth + Row Level Security. RLS does permissions in the database: a salesperson can only read/edit leads assigned to them; owner sees everything.
- **Frontend hosting: Vercel or Cloudflare Pages** (free tier), not Render. Render only if a persistent Node service is ever needed beyond Supabase Edge Functions.
- Planned tables: `profiles` (role: owner|member), `projects`, `project_members`, `leads`, and sales stored as converted leads (amount, verified, converted_by, closed date).
- Running cost target: **₹0** on free tiers.

## The original brief

- **metrol.in** = a simple one-page gate. Logo, short description, sign in. Not a marketing site.
- **Two roles only:** owner, and team member (salesperson). Email + password each.
- **Owner:** sees project cards → clicks one → that project's dashboard.
- **Project dashboard sections, in this order:** KPI row (total leads / connected / follow-up / customers / gross sale) → **Leads** → **Sales** → **Team tracking** → **Sales dashboard** (today / this week / month / year). Sidebar scroll-spies between them.
- **Leads columns:** S.No, name, email, phone, connected, status, quality, assigned-to (+ assign popup).
- **Quality** = Good / Average / Bad — green / yellow / red. Set by the salesperson.
- **Status** = New / Connected / Follow-up / Converted / Dead.
- **Sales:** customer, amount, payment verified or not, who converted it.
- **Salesperson dashboard:** only their assigned leads, a new-lead notification, update status + quality, convert.
- **Must work on mobile**, though the manager uses a MacBook.
- **Emphasized hardest: Excel-like resizable columns that feel smooth.** Never regress this.

## Interpretation decisions already made (client has NOT confirmed these yet)

1. **Team tracking = one row per salesperson** (a leaderboard). The brief mixed "date, client name" with per-member totals; those are two different tables.
2. **"Connected" is calculated from Status**, not typed separately — avoids double data entry.
3. **Dead leads render grey, not red**, so red only ever means "bad quality".
4. **Row height → a Compact/Comfortable density switch**, instead of dragging individual rows taller.
5. **Converting a lead prompts for the amount and creates the Sales row.** This is what links Leads to Sales; owner then verifies payment.
6. Added a **Closed date** column to Sales and a **last-7-days bar chart** to the Sales dashboard.
7. **Landing page copy and logo are placeholder** — real ones not supplied yet.

## Open questions for the client (still unanswered)

1. **Where do leads come from?** Manual entry / CSV upload / Meta lead-form webhook? Adarsh runs their Meta ads, so likely Meta. **This changes the data model — get the answer before scaffolding the real app.**
2. Real logo file + a real paragraph describing Metrol Media.
3. Team tracking says "number of calls connected" — currently counts *leads* connected. True per-call counts need a "log call" button. Wanted or not?
4. Does Gross Sale include unverified payments? (Currently yes, with pending shown separately.)

# NEXT UP — requested changes, not yet done

These came from Adarsh on 2026-09-04 after reviewing the prototype. Apply them to `design/metrol-crm-prototype.html`, then republish to the **same** artifact URL above.

## 1. Rebrand to the Metrol Media palette (black / white / yellow)

Metrol Media's brand colours are **black, white, and yellow**. Replace the blue accent (`--accent:#1E4FD8` / `#6E99FF`) throughout.

- **Premium black-and-white base**, with **yellow as the highlight colour** — active sidebar item, focus rings, selected states, the accented KPI rule.
- **Neutrals should be true black/white/grey**, not the current blue-tinted greys.
- **Contrast warning:** yellow text on white fails legibility. Use yellow as a *fill* with black text on top, never as small text on a light ground. Suggested: `#F5C518`-ish. In dark mode a slightly warmer/brighter yellow reads better on black.
- **Primary buttons:** black with white text in light mode, white/near-white with black text in dark mode. Reserve yellow for active/highlight states so it stays meaningful.
- **Keep the semantic colours as they are** — green / amber / red for status and quality chips. Adarsh explicitly said these stay.

## 2. Projects screen — smaller cards + a list view

- Cards are currently too wide. Show **3 per row** on desktop so they read as a scannable grid, not one project per horizontal band.
- Add a **Cards / List toggle**.
- **List view** = a proper table: serial number, project thumbnail, project name, description, leads, customers, gross sale, status. Clicking a row opens the project.
- Support an optional **project photo/preview image**, shown in both card and list view, with a sensible placeholder when a project has none.

## 3. Two sidebars inside a project (the big structural change)

Right now, switching projects means going back to the home screen. Instead:

- **Sidebar 1 — projects.** Lists all the owner's projects so they can jump straight between them. Recommend a narrow **icon rail (~64px)** of project monograms with names on hover, plus an "All projects" entry at the top — this preserves horizontal room for the data grid, which matters because the leads table is ~1144px wide. If Adarsh prefers full names visible, widen it to ~200px instead.
- **Sidebar 2 — sections within the current project:** Overview, Leads, Sales, Team tracking, Sales dashboard. This is the existing scroll-spy nav; keep that behaviour.
- On mobile both must collapse — projects into a topbar dropdown, sections into the existing horizontal chip strip.

## 4. Light/dark mode toggle as a real product control

Currently the theme switch only lives in the black "Prototype" panel. Add a proper **sun/moon toggle button in the app topbar**, and persist the choice to `localStorage` (wrap reads/writes in try/catch — it throws in some contexts). Keep all three theme states working: explicit light, explicit dark, and unstamped "follow the device".

---

## Working rules

- **Do not scaffold the real app** until the prototype is signed off by Metrol Media *and* the lead-source question is answered.
- Keep the minimalism rule. Polish over features.
- Test changes in the browser before claiming they work — this project has already had two real bugs (a resize drag that broke when the pointer left the handle, and a drag guide that got stuck on screen) that only surfaced through actual interaction testing.
